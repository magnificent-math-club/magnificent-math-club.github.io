      <description>Magnificent Summer Math Programs Thank you for your interest in our summer math programs! We are a group of math-lovers who have enjoyed the beauty of math and competed in math competitions. We want to offer some opportunities for kids to enjoy math during summer break.
We have adopted the AoPS textbooks, which we have found very beneficial to our learning in math. We have 1-hour class time via Zoom every week and also assign weekly homework, which will take around 15-30 minutes.</description>
